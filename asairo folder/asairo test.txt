Sasamaru: ...I like Hiyo.

Waka: Hmm, then, is it big sis?

Sasamaru: But when asked "who do you want to save?"...I cannot answer.

Sasamaru: I want to save them all. The girls saved me. It was them who drove away that darkness.

Sasamaru: ...I cannot choose...just one.

Waka: Talk about selfish.

Sasamaru: I beg you. I don't care what happens to me.

Waka: ...

Sasamaru: I beg you!!

Waka: ...I refuse.

Sasamaru: Waka-san!!

Waka: That is not the answer.

Sasamaru: The answer...?

Sasamaru: Nnnggghh...!!

But I'll say this.

I'll hold my head high and say this.

Sasamaru: Aah...what a nice weather.
